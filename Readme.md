# Frequency-Importance Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Lightweight Radiance Field Rendering

Welcome to the official repository for the "Frequency-Importance Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Lightweight Radiance Field Rendering" project. This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and performance of radiance field rendering through a novel approach that integrates frequency-importance considerations into Gaussian splatting techniques.

## Overview

This project introduces an innovative method to optimize radiance field rendering for real-time applications and lightweight systems. By leveraging frequency-importance Gaussian splatting, our approach aims to achieve a balance between high fidelity rendering and computational efficiency, making it suitable for scenarios where resources are limited.

## Features

- **Frequency-Sensitive Loss Function**: Tailored to emphasize high-frequency details while maintaining overall image fidelity, enhancing the quality of synthesized views.
- **Dynamically Adaptive Density Control Strategy**: Optimizes the generation of Gaussians during training to prevent unnecessary data proliferation, improving efficiency and reducing memory usage.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the development phase, with the team working diligently towards finalizing the core algorithms and optimization techniques. Due to laboratory regulations, the full source code and detailed documentation will be made available upon the project's completion.

## Expected Release

The source code and all related materials are expected to be open-sourced on GitHub after the project cycle concludes. We anticipate making the repository public three months following the formal acceptance and publication of our research findings.
